# CAPWAP Overview for CCNA

## **Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP)**

CAPWAP is a protocol that allows Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC) to manage multiple Access Points (APs) remotely. It operates over two main UDP ports:
- **5246** for control messages (encrypted with DTLS)
- **5247** for data messages (can be encrypted or unencrypted)

## **CAPWAP Control Messages**
Control messages are essential for communication between APs and WLC. These messages travel through an **encrypted DTLS tunnel** on UDP **5246**.

### **Types of Control Messages:**
1. **Discovery Request / Response**
   - The AP sends a request to discover available WLCs.
   - The WLC responds with availability information.

2. **Join Request / Response**
   - The AP attempts to join a WLC.
   - The WLC authenticates and accepts the AP.

3. **Configuration Request / Response**
   - The AP requests its configuration from the WLC.
   - The WLC sends SSID, VLAN, encryption settings, and radio parameters.

4. **Image Download Request / Response**
   - If the AP does not have the correct firmware, the WLC provides an update.

5. **Keepalive / Echo Request / Response**
   - AP and WLC exchange messages to verify connectivity.
   - If the AP loses contact with WLC, it may reboot or connect to another WLC.

6. **Statistics and Event Messages**
   - AP sends statistics and logs to the WLC (radio status, connected clients, interference levels).

7. **De-authentication and Disconnection**
   - WLC can disconnect an AP due to policy violations or malfunctions.

## **CAPWAP Connection Process (AP to WLC)**
1. **Boot**
   - The AP obtains an IP address via DHCP (optional: DNS lookup for WLC).

2. **Discovery**
   - The AP searches for a WLC using:
     - **DHCP Option 43**
     - **DNS (CISCO-CAPWAP-CONTROLLER.localdomain)**
     - **Broadcast or Unicast to known WLC IPs**

3. **Join**
   - The AP authenticates itself to the WLC using certificates or PSK.

4. **Image Download (if needed)**
   - If the AP does not have the correct firmware, the WLC provides it.

5. **Configuration**
   - The WLC sends the AP its full configuration (SSID, VLANs, power settings, security settings).

6. **Run Mode (Operational Mode)**
   - The AP begins providing Wi-Fi connectivity to clients.

7. **Heartbeat / Keepalive**
   - The AP periodically communicates with the WLC to confirm it is still online.

## **CAPWAP Data Tunnel (Data Plane)**
The data tunnel transmits client data between the AP and the WLC.
- Operates over **UDP 5247**.
- Can be **encrypted or unencrypted**.
- Supports **local switching** (direct routing at AP) or **centralized switching** (tunnel traffic through WLC).

## **CAPWAP Architectures: Centralized vs. FlexConnect**
1. **Centralized (Local Mode)**
   - All traffic is tunneled to the WLC.
   - Ideal for large networks requiring centralized security and management.

2. **FlexConnect (formerly H-REAP)**
   - APs can function without constant WLC connectivity.
   - Data can be **locally switched** at the AP instead of being tunneled to WLC.
   - Useful for branch offices or small networks with minimal WLC dependence.

## **Wireshark CAPWAP Debugging**
To analyze CAPWAP communication, use the following Wireshark filter:
```bash
udp.port == 5246 || udp.port == 5247
```
Key CAPWAP packets:
- **Discovery Request / Response**
- **Join Request / Response**
- **Keepalive (Echo Request / Response)**
- **Data Tunnel Traffic**

# Difference Between CAPWAP and LWAPP

Before CAPWAP, Cisco used **LWAPP (Lightweight Access Point Protocol)** to manage wireless access points. CAPWAP replaced LWAPP because it supports encryption and newer wireless standards (802.11n and beyond).

| **Feature**                | **CAPWAP**           | **LWAPP**               |
|----------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Control Message Encryption | Yes (DTLS)           | Yes                     |
| Data Packet Encryption     | Optional             | No                      |
| Standardized by IETF       | Yes                  | No (Cisco proprietary)  |
| Supports 802.11n and newer | Yes                  | No                      |
| Transport Protocol         | UDP                  | UDP                     |
| Ports Used                 | 5246 (Control), 5247 (Data) | 12222 (Control), 12223 (Data) |

In summary, CAPWAP is a more secure and flexible replacement for LWAPP, allowing support for modern wireless technologies while maintaining central management of access points.


## **Summary**
- **CAPWAP enables remote AP management through WLC using UDP 5246 (control) and UDP 5247 (data).**
- **APs follow a process: Boot â†’ Discovery â†’ Join â†’ Configuration â†’ Run Mode.**
- **FlexConnect allows APs to operate independently if the WLC is unavailable.**
- **Wireshark debugging can help analyze CAPWAP communication issues.**

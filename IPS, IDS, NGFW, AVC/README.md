# IPS, IDS, and NGFW
In network security, IPS (Intrusion Prevention System), IDS (Intrusion Detection System), and NGFW (Next-Generation Firewall) play vital roles in protecting networks from malicious activities. Here’s a detailed breakdown of each, along with their differences and use cases.

# 1. IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is designed to detect unauthorized access or suspicious activities within a network. It monitors network traffic and identifies potential threats based on predefined patterns or anomalies. IDS is a passive security solution—it alerts the network administrator but does not take action to block the attack.

### How It Works:
<b>Signature-Based Detection:</b> Compares incoming traffic to known attack signatures.

<b>Anomaly-Based Detection:</b> Identifies deviations from normal network behavior (traffic volume, patterns).

### Protocols Supported:
+ SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)
+ NetFlow
+ IPFIX (Internet Protocol Flow Information Export)

### Where It’s Used:
Detection of threats, monitoring systems, identifying unauthorized access attempts, and policy violations.

Often used in combination with firewalls and other security systems.

<b>Advantages:</b>
Detects known threats quickly.

Provides visibility into network traffic and potential vulnerabilities.

<b>Disadvantages:</b>
Passive: Only detects and alerts—doesn’t block attacks.

High false positives can lead to alert fatigue.

# 2. IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)
An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is similar to an IDS but with a key difference—it actively prevents attacks. When an IPS detects malicious activity, it can take automatic actions to stop the attack, such as blocking traffic, resetting a connection, or even modifying firewall rules.

### How It Works:
<b>Signature-Based Detection:</b> Identifies threats based on predefined signatures, much like IDS.

<b>Anomaly-Based Detection:</b> Monitors behavior deviations to detect new threats.

<b>Prevention:</b> IPS not only detects but also blocks malicious traffic in real time.

### Protocols Supported:
+ HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
+ HTTPS (Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
+ FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
+ SMB (Server Message Block)
+ DNS (Domain Name System)

### Where It’s Used:
Prevention of cyberattacks, malware, and zero-day attacks.

Frequently deployed in conjunction with firewalls for enhanced security.

<b>Advantages:</b>
Active Defense: Automatically blocks malicious traffic.

Can mitigate zero-day vulnerabilities by analyzing traffic behavior.

<b>Disadvantages:</b>
Can potentially block legitimate traffic if not configured correctly.

High performance overhead on the network.

# 3. NGFW (Next-Generation Firewall)
A Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) is an advanced firewall solution that goes beyond traditional packet filtering and stateful inspection. NGFWs integrate multiple security features, including IPS/IDS, application awareness, user identity management, and deep packet inspection (DPI), to detect and block sophisticated attacks.

### How It Works:
<b>Deep Packet Inspection (DPI):</b> Inspects the payload of network traffic, not just the header, for threats.

<b>Application Awareness: </b>Identifies and controls traffic based on the application layer, rather than just ports or protocols.

<b>Integrated IPS/IDS:</b> Combines the capabilities of both IPS and IDS.

<b>URL Filtering and Malware Inspection:</b> Scans for malicious URLs, files, or downloads.

### Protocols Supported:
+ HTTP/S
+ SSL/TLS
+ DNS
+ SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
+ FTP

### Where It’s Used:
Advanced threat protection for enterprises, securing web traffic, preventing data exfiltration, and controlling user access.

NGFWs are typically deployed at the network perimeter (before the network's internal infrastructure) and at data center edges.

<b>Advantages:</b>
Comprehensive Protection: Combines multiple security functions in one device.

Provides visibility into application traffic, enabling more granular control.

Helps with compliance by inspecting encrypted traffic (e.g., SSL/TLS).

<b>Disadvantages:</b>
Resource-Intensive: Requires significant processing power, which can affect network performance if not properly sized.

Complex configuration and false positives can occur if policies aren’t fine-tuned.

## AVC (Application Visibility and Control) 
AVC is a feature provided by Cisco in Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW), as well as Cisco routers and switches, to help monitor and control application traffic in a network. AVC allows administrators to gain insight into application performance and identify how specific applications are using network resources.

+ Key Features of AVC:
Application Identification: AVC can identify applications regardless of port or protocol, including encrypted traffic.

<b>Traffic Shaping and QoS (Quality of Service):</b> Administrators can define policies for prioritizing certain types of traffic or applications.

<b>Traffic Analysis and Reporting:</b> AVC helps in providing detailed metrics for application performance, including response times, bandwidth usage, and top users.

In essence, AVC gives network administrators the visibility to understand and control application-level traffic, ensuring that critical applications are prioritized and perform optimally.


### When and Where to Use These Systems:
<b>IDS:</b> Ideal for environments where you need to detect and alert without taking action. Often used for monitoring network traffic and identifying threats.

<b>IPS:</b> Best suited for situations where real-time threat prevention is required, and immediate action to block harmful traffic is necessary.

<b>NGFW:</b> The best solution for organizations needing comprehensive security with features like application awareness, deep packet inspection, and integrated IPS/IDS. It’s a powerful all-in-one defense for enterprises.

### Conclusion
IDS is mainly for detection and alerting.

IPS adds the layer of active prevention.

NGFW is an all-in-one security appliance that includes features like deep packet inspection, application control, IPS, and firewall capabilities.
